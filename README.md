# Correlation Between Keystroke Dynamics On Mobile Devices With Time
Supervisor: Prof Alan Smeaton(Dublin City University)

In this research we set out to find the answer to the question of how features associated with  keystroke dynamics when using a mobile device, such as typing speed varies in accordance with the time of day for a typical user. We do this by collecting keystroke dynamics metadata using an Android keyboard application called Language Logger, from a set of 15 users over a period 80 days with metadata for 344,995 actual keystrokes.  This includes date and time of typing on the smartphone, along with timing information covering dwell time while a key is pressed, and flight time as the time taken to move to the next key, in a stream of continuous keyboard data entry.
Our results find that there are large variance across users and some are affected by time of day while others are not.However, there are other factors which impact alertness and hence typing speed which we cannot account for such as mood or energy level, and this would be future work.
